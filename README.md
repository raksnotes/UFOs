# UFOs

For the app.js file, I had referenced the video hint in the challenge instructions as well as the starter code files as noted in the challenge instructions to see if I was on the right track and to help out with the filterTable() and updateFilters() functions in terms of learning and applying how to update filters based on certain criteria, like stated in the instructions.

## DELIVERABLE 2: 
### Purpose: 
to use JavaScript to analyze, filter and output a data table based on UFO sightings criteria. 

## Results: 
For someone new to navigating this webpage, the process consists of entering a date, and clicking filter to filter out the necessary data, so that it would display the data that they would be interested in looking at. 

### Summary: 
One drawback that I noticed, is that the data range is not very expansive. 

I recommend that for future analysis, it would be interesting to see the frequency of shape sightings, and an additional recommendation would be to expand the time to search for UFO sightings.
