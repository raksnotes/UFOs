# UFOs

For the app.js file, I had referenced the video hint in the challenge instructions as well as checking the web files given in the starter code to see if I was on the right track and to help out with the filterTable() and updateFilters() functions in terms of learning and applying how to update filters based on certain criteria, like stated in the instructions. 


DELIVERABLE 1: 







DELIVERABLE 2: 
## The purpose of this project is to use JavaScript to analyze, filter and output a data table based on UFO sightings criteria. 

## Results: For someone new to navigating this webpage, the process consists of entering a date, and clicking filter to filter out the necessary data, so that it would display the data that they would be interested in looking at. 

## One drawback that I noticed, is that the data range is not very expansive; I think it would be really interesting to see the frequency of UFO shape sightings for example, over a course of years
