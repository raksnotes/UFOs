# UFOs

For the app_1.js file, I had referenced the video hint in the challenge instructions as well as my original app.js file to help out with the filterTable() and updateFilters() functions in terms of learning and applying how to update filters based on certain criteria, like stated in the instructions, however wasn't able to finish the assignment (Deliverable 1) completely. 

DELIVERABLE 1: 

As shown below: the first part of instructions' output came out correctly based on module work: 
Though, unable to output css style accurately.

DELIVERABLE 2: 
## The purpose of this project is to use JavaScript to analyze, filter and output a data table based on UFO sightings criteria. 

I was able to import the data into the html on Chrome, and filter the data using a filter button. 
I had run into some challenges when doing this analysis: 

1. In ref to 12.6.1: 
When displaying the table, the table and corresponding attributes had shown and the filter button worked, however, the table was shown at the bottom of the 
filter button instead of at the right of the filter button as shown in the Module output: 
ref to 12.6.3 

2. Following module instructions to use CSS to style the html, I ran into a difficulty of being unable to see the rest of the page clearly once I ran and debugged the code 

## Results: For someone new to navigating this webpage, the process consists of entering a date, and clicking filter to filter out the necessary data, so that it would display the data that they would be interested in looking at. 

## One drawback that I noticed, is that the data range is not very expansive; I think it would be really interesting to see the frequency of UFO shape sightings for example, over a course of years
